# Deliverable 0

## What is the project focus/overall goal?
The city allocates money to various funds designed to offer relief and support to benefit residents and businesses in Boston. \
Our client wants to understand whether these benefits are being distributed equitably and if the money the city said they were going to spend has reached and impacted the people they said it would serve. \
Thus, generally, the goal of our project is to assess whether the money is going and if it is being equitably distributed to the target audience. <br>

## What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
Basically, we start with three datasheets, Business Assistance Funds, Business license and Census dataset.  
Those datasheets contain information about small business relief grant recipients, 2020 Census data for the city of Boston and Boston neighborhoods and business and entertainment licenses.

## What are potential limitations of the project?
Our dataset is not up to date. We only have census data for 2020.

## Why is this project important or Why did you choose this project?
In this time of economic uncertainty directly resulting from the devastating Coronavirus, Boston must not deviate from its goal to reduce income inequality and help elevate all of its residents. The project can help reallocate resources to equity efforts, protect income equity and mobility, protect the vulnerable and provide equitable access to city services.

## What are your teamâ€™s next steps? (include action items/tasks)
Learn what the datasheets mean. <br>
Organize this data based on census block groups.  <br>
