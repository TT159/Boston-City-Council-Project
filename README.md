## Base Project
The city allocates money to various funds designed to offer relief and support to benefit residents and businesses in Boston. Councilor Mejia wants to understand whether these benefits are being distributed equitably and if the money the city said they were going to spend has reached and impacted the people they said it would serve. The goal is to assess whether the money is going and if it is being equitably distributed.
